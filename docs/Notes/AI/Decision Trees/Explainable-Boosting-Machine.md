# Explainable Boosting Machine

[Explainable Boosting Machine](https://interpret.ml/docs/ebm.html)  
  

> Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is a tree-based, cyclic gradient boosting Generalized Additive Model with automatic interaction detection. EBMs are often as accurate as state-of-the-art blackbox models while remaining completely interpretable. Although EBMs are often slower to train than other modern algorithms, EBMs are extremely compact and fast at prediction time.
