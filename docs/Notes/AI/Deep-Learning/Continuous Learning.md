[[Deep Learning]]
# Continuous Learning

> continuously learn and acquire new knowledge, doing this by updating the [[Deep Learning]] model with the new data

## Advantages

- enables two important aspects:
	- adaptability 
	- scalability

## Challenges

Catastrophic forgetting: Rapid overriding of weights, when [[Neural Networks]] are trained only on new data
