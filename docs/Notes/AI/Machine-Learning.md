## What is Machine Learning?


### From the web

- [Computer Scientist Explains Machine Learning in 5 Levels of Difficulty | 5 Levels | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/video/watch/5-levels-machine-learning?c=series) 


## Methods

- [[Decision Trees]]
- [[Neural Networks]]

## Learn

### Simple Introduction

- [A free online introduction to artificial intelligence for non-experts](https://www.elementsofai.com/) 

### Courses

#### Beginner

- [microsoft/ML-For-Beginners: 12 weeks, 25 lessons, 50 quizzes, classic Machine Learning for all](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners)

#### For Scientist and Engineers

- [ME 597 - Data Analytics for Scientists and Engineering at Purdue University](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/data-analytics-se)

#### Systems

- [CS 329S | Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/index.html#overview)  

> The course covers all the steps from project scoping, data management, model development, deployment, infrastructure, team structure, to business analysis. At each step, it goes over the motivations, challenges, and limitations, if any, of different solutions. The course ends with a discussion on the future of the machine learning production ecosystem.
