## What is Open Science?



> Open Science is an umbrella term for a wide range of (proposed) structural changes in the ways science is done. It ranges from Open Access publishing, publishing manuscripts, open peer review and pre-registration of analyses, to open data, open protocols/methods and open source, as well as methods to make data and code Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).
