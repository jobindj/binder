- Ensure code is running as intended, especially making sure that old code is still working when new code is introduced

Levels of testing

- Unit test : evaluate individual modules, as stand alones
- Integration test : evaluate more than one modules together, making sure they work well together
- Functional test: end-to-end testing of library features
