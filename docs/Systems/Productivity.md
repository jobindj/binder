# Productivity

Some tips

- Daily highlight: Write down 1 thing that needs to get down that day, focus on it. (Book: Make time)
- Use a to-do list
- Time blocking: blocks on calendar (Cal Newport)
- Parkinson's law: work expands to fill the time we allocate to it.
- Protected time: keep recurring blocks of time for focused work. For example, no Zoom calls in the mornings
- Delegation
- Automated scheduling (Calendly) [^1]
