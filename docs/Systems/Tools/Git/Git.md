> tool for version control

## Lingo 

- Commit: a new revision/edit/unit of change
- [[git-branch|Branch]]: tag pointing to an independent line of commits, branched from the default line 
	- The default branch used to called `master`. It is more common to call it  `main` now


## Advanced

- [[git-worktree|Git Worktree]] : open multiple branches/commits as different folders
