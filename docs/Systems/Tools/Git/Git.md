# Git 

> tool for version control

## Lingo 

- Commit: a new revision/edit/unit of change
- [[git-branch|Branch]]: tag pointing to an independent line of commits, branched from the default line 
	- The default branch used to called `master`. It is more common to call it  `main` now


## [[Visualization]] for Git

- A better way than file-and-folder view to get an overview of a repo? Fingerprint using [githubocto/repo-visualizer](https://octo.github.com/projects/repo-visualization)
	-  [Web app](https://octo-repo-visualization.vercel.app/)
	-  [Repo](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer)

## Advanced

- [[git worktree]] : open multiple branches/commits as different folders
